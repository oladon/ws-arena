This project is provided primarily as an example of using Hunchensocket* to host an 
interactive game server. It uses the game in pf-arena (which uses the textengine 
project as its back-end).

NOTE: You won't be able to actually run this code, as it requires the textengine 
project, which is not yet publically available. In addition, it requires a few 
changes to Hunchensocket; I'm working on getting these changes into a form that 
could be easily integrated with the library.
